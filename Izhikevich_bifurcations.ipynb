    "\n",
    "The first argument that we use is `bidirectional=True`. If this is set to true, PyCoBi will automatically run two continuations: One where it will continue the solution curve for decreasing values of the continuation paramter, and one where it will continue the solution curve for increasing values of the continuation paramter. Sometimes, you are only interested in one particular continuation direction. In this case, you can set `bidirectional=False`, which is also the default behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The third argument that we use is `c=\"ivp\"`. This tells PyCoBi that there exists a meta parameter file called `c.ivp` in the same directory, where also the equation file `ik.f90` is located, that contains all the meta parameters that control the numerical algorithms that PyCoBi runs via Auto-07p in the background.\n",
    "We will not bother with explaining most of the parameters that control specific details of the numerical parameter continuation and bifurcation detection algorithms. Instead, we will focus on those parameters that you will always need to change depending on which continuation problem you are facing.\n",
    "The parameters that we won't explain are those listed in the dictionary `algorithm_params`. We re-defined them here to choose an optimal set of default parameters for all continuations that we will perform. \n",
    "For a detailed explanation of those parameters, have a look at the [Auto-07p documentation](https://github.com/auto-07p/auto-07p/tree/master/doc).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "All other keyword argument that follow are Auto-o7p parameters that overwrite the default behavior as defined in `c.ivp`.\n",
    "Here is a quick overview of what they do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ICP`: This is the most important Auto-07p parameter. It is used to specify the continuation parameter(s). You can either pass a single or multiple continuation parameters. Also, you can either use the index of the continuation parameter in the `args` vector of the `subroutine stpnt` in the `ik.f90` file, or simply use the string-based name of the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IPS`: This defines the basic problem type for which to run continuations. `IPS=1` corresponds to the continuation of a steady-state solution of an ODE system, whereas `IPS=2` corresponds to the continuation of a periodic solution of an ODE system. There exist many other options for `IPS`, but those we will not cover as part of this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `ILP`: This parameter can be used to toggle fold bifurcation detection on (`ILP=1`) or off (`ILP=0`). Turn this off for any continuation where you don't expect fold bifurcations to appear (e.g. parameter continuations with two independent continuation parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ISP`: This controls the detection of any bifurcations related to periodic solutions, such as Hopf bifurcations, period doubling bifurcations, and torus bifurcations. The most important options here are `ISP=0` (turn off detection of bifurcations related to periodic solutions), `ISP=1` (enable calculation of floquet multipliers for periodic solutions), and `ISP=2` (turn of floquet multipler calculation and bifurcation detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ISW`: This controls the switching behavior between solution branches that collide at a bifurcation point. Important options here are: `ISW=1` (standard behavior, no branch switching is done at special solutions for ODEs), `ISW=2` (allows the calculation of a curve of special solutions such as fold/hopf bifurcations in 2-3 continuation parameters), and `ISW=-1` (switch the branch at a branching point such as a hopf bifurcation or a period doubling bifurcation and perform continuation of this branch).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `RL0` and `RL1`: The minimum and maximum value that the main continuation parameter should take on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `UZR`: This allows to mark solutions where the continuation parameter takes on a specific value. For example, if `UZR={\"eta\": 0.0}` the solution where $\\eta = 0.0$ pA will be marked as a special solution with tag \"UZ1\", which can be used for follow-up continuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `STOP`: This allows to define a stopping criterion for the parameter continuation. For example, `STOP=[\"UZ1\"]` defines that the parameter continuation is supposed to stop at the first solution that the algorithm encounters, which meets one of the criteria defined in `UZR`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NPR`: This is the sampling rate for the solutions along the solution branch. `NPR=100` means that every 100th solution of the continuation procedure is stored for plotting etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NMX`: This controls the maximum number of continuation steps. `NMX=8000` means that the continuation will stop, after it has performed 4000 iterations of the algorithm, no matter what the value of the continuation parameter is at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DSMAX`: This controls the maximum step-size that the algorithm is allowed to make when increasing/decreasing the continuation parameter.\n",
    "\n",
